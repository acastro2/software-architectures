For each exercise will try to complete all the steps described below.

## The Problem

What is the problem we are trying to solve, or which new solution/implementation are we trying to achieve?

A quick overview of the current architecture and technologies.

## Proposed solution

For this will use C4 model diagrams and UML when needed.

* [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/)
* [UML Diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html)

## Proposed Architecture

This will take into account current architecture and expand it based on its constraints.

## Cloud-Native Architecture

For the sake of the exercise, we will provide an architecture using only (or mostly) cloud.

## Ideas for future development

Ideas on how to improve the design further or how to integrate with known systems.
